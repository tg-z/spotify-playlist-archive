> Daily snapshots of public Spotify playlists

Spotify's playlists are great. I like that they're updated once in a while -
change is good! I don't like, however, that it's impossible to see older
versions. How am I supposed to remember the name of that song I really liked?
Apparently, I'm not alone: see

Since Spotify won't take snapshots of our favorite playlists, let's do it ourselves!

## Quick start

1. To view the current version of a playlist, click on its name [below](https://github.com/mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive#playlists)
1. To see all songs that ever belonged to a playlist, click "cumulative"
1. To determine which songs were added or removed from a playlist, click "githistory"
1. To add a playlist to the archive, simply `touch playlists/plain/<playlist_id>` and make a pull request

## How it works

This repository contains a script for scraping Spotify playlists and publishing
them back to the repo. The script is run daily via
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive/actions/workflows/main.yml).
It's also run after every commit, which means that playlists get regenerated
whenever the scraping or formatting logic changes, or when new playlists are
added - cool!

The script determines which playlists to scrape by looking at the file names in
`playlists/plain`. Files get regenerated as follows: a pretty version of each
playlist gets dumped in `playlists/pretty`, new tracks are added to the
files in `playlists/cumulative`, and a plaintext version of each playlist is
written back to `playlists/plain`. The plain version is sorted alphabetically,
rather than by track number, so that it only changes when tracks are added or
removed, making [Git History](https://githistory.xyz/) a nice way to visualize
how the playlist evolves over time.
